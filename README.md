This is a free, non-commercial tool to help users explore, select, and export accessibility and placement adjustments.
It was designed primarily for students and staff in healthcare, but can be adapted for other settings.

**How to Use**
1. Open the HTML file in a web browser (no installation needed!).
2. Use the filters, search bar, or quiz to look through and select adjustments.
3. Save your selections to a text file to reload later (Save to File), or export a printable summary to share with educators or keep for your own reference (Save Summary).
